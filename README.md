# test-login
for the login test i use PyCharm to writh the code 
if using Pychram to run the code (login.py) 
the script is expecting that the user will enter the email and password.
you should see a message on the console for the user to input the credential
there is a validation for the login screen is up and runnign 
there is a validation for the email address that the user is entering 
and in the end the script also simulate the login button (but no response is givin from the server side)
